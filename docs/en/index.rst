`Matter`_ is a unified IP-based
connectivity protocol that is designed to connect and build open, reliable
and secure IoT ecosystems. This new technology and connectivity standard enables
communication among a wide range of smart devices. Matter supports IP connectivity over Wi-Fi, Thread and Ethernet.

Espressif's SDK for Matter is the official Matter development framework for
Espressif's ESP32 series SoCs.
